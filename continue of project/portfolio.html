                    <p class="section1_right_desc">Productivity plays a significant role in both economy and individuality. The latter is known
                        chiefly as personal productivity, which is how efficiently one can complete tasks vital to him or
                        her in a consistent way. In economics, on the other hand, productivity measures output per unit
                        of input, such as labor, capital, or any other resource. It is often calculated for the economy as a
                        ratio of GDP to hours worked. Similarly, the standard of living for the country as a whole
                        depends on improvement in overall productivity. Historically, productivity growth has led to
                        higher wages for workers and higher profits.</p>

        <section class="container-md container-sm section2 my-5">
            <div class="row d-flex align-items-center justify-content-around flex-row-reverse">
                <div class="col col-md-8 col-sm-12 section2_left"></div>
                <div class="col col-md-4 col-sm-12 section2_right">
                    <p class="section2_right_desc">What is the purpose of productivity? Why every company wants to see a higher productive
                        labor force? How can productivity contribute to the growth of the economy?
                        Letâ€™s start with the purpose of improving productivity for management. Since the improvement
                        of productivity allows producing more products or services from the same resources, hence
                        profit will be more. Moreover, increases in productivity allow management to sell a product at a
                        lower price than the competition and to stand better in the competitive market.
                        Workers can significantly benefit from high productivity, too. Higher profits imply more profit
                        for the organization, and that helps workers to get more wages and better working conditions,
                        and the standard of living will be higher. For customers, an increase in productivity means that
                        consumers will be able to buy more amounts of goods at a lower price, and it will improve their
                        living standard.</p>

        <section class="container-md container-sm section3 my-5">
            <div class="row d-flex align-items-center">
                <div class="col col-md-6 col-sm-12 section3_left"></div>
                <div class="col col-md-4 col-sm-12 section3_right">
                    <p class="section3_right_desc">However, productivity can only sometimes be kept consistent. There are many factors affecting
                        productivity. For example, in human resources, a general level of education is essential for
                        workers to operate a computer and other electronic equipment, and educated employees are
                        needed. Pay is needed. They need to have excellent and safe working conditions to perform
                        better.
                        The second factor is product design. Through better product design, unnecessary parts can be
                        eliminated, by this way use of materials can be reduced with the cost of labor, equipment and
                        etc. This will allow for lowering the price of the product and make it more affordable to
                        customers> the role of research and development is vital for effective product design.
                        Third on the list is a technology and capital investment. One of the significant factors in
                        continuing productivity improvement is technology and capital investment. New technology
                        depends on the research and development department to apply new technology, and investment
                        in the latest machinery and equipment is significant.</p>

        <section class="container-md container-sm section4 my-5">
            <div class="row d-flex align-items-center justify-content-around flex-row-reverse">
                <div class="col col-md-8 col-sm-12 section4_left"></div>
                <div class="col col-md-4 col-sm-12 section4_right">
                    <p class="section4_right_desc">Fourth is machinery and equipment. Machines, conveyors, and robots all are important factors
                        in productivity. Computer-aided design and CNC have become essential ingredients in
                        productivity improvement. It helps to make complicated parts very quickly, and the proper
                        layout of the plant and machinery is fundamental to increasing productivity. It reduces the
                        material handling cost and reduces rest time, thus improving productivity.
                        Fifth is the skill and effectiveness of the worker. A trained worker can do the same job in a
                        much shorter time than a regular worker. However, even well-trained employees must be
                        motivated to be productive.Sixth is production volume. If the magnitude of the output is to be increased, the number of
                        direct workers and indirect workers needs to be improved. But there would not be required for
                        more engineers, research scientists, and headquarter staff. So the increase in the
                        production volume increases productivity.
                        The final factor on the list is government regulation. The government can eliminate unnecessary
                        rules and make a cost-benefit analysis to determine necessary regulations such as health and
                        safety. More rules and regulations make the process complicated, and it negatively affects
                        productivity.</p>
